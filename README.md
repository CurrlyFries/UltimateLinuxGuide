# Ultimate Linux Guide
A guide I'm making to solve problems I have had setting up linux for Gaming and productivity

Welcome to the guide :)

I've been using ubuntu since october 2024 and plan on using it forever, but a lot of that time has been spent fixing weird issuses I've had.

This guide will aim to make solving these issues easier for everyone else who may encounter them.
